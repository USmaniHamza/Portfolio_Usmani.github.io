        <div class="ProjectDescription">
            <p>
                An online class management system similar to that of <strong>Google Classroom</strong> but it has a
                platform of it's own with it's own student performance tracking system purely based on <strong>
                    Data Visualization</strong> for both students and faculty members for better communication . The
                tools that aided this project are <strong>JAVA SE-8</strong> , basic <strong>Java-Swing</strong> and
                <strong>JFreeCharts</strong> library .
            </p>
        </div>

            <p>
                This image is based on the UI of the teachers home page after logging in, the table platform as we see
                is to mark out students from all section under the responsibility of the teachers, the students that
                need <strong>attention</strong> is going to be auto-marked out based on the weak performances
                as soon as they receive
                their scores . An option of reviewing overall student performances based on the first
                <strong>50</strong>
                overall marks
                before the mid-term exams so that students can get a heads up before the finals in order to improve
                their performances .
            </p>
            <p>
                The fields at the bottom of the page is to filter out the students in order to submit their scores which
                is handled by a database at the back-end .

            <p>
                This image indicates where the particular students were lacking in performance compared to what the
                students were supposed to achieve in order to receive good scores .
            </p>

            <p>
                The <strong>Blue Shade</strong> indicates what was expected as output performances from the students and
                the <strong>Red Shade</strong> indicates what the students in particular actually achieved as scores .

            <img src="img/RadarChart.PNG" class="first" />
            <p>
                This image is about <strong>Data Visualization</strong> of the scores students achieved within the first
                fifty marks
                using <strong>Spider Charts</strong> or <strong>Radar Charts</strong> .
            </p>

            <p>
                The edges close to the arc of the circle will determine how well the student is performing
                throughout
                the mid-terms. A small message-box telling the user what each degrees mean for example the edge at
                <strong>45</strong>
                degrees mean what the student achieved in the best Quiz marks taken out of the total Quizzes given
                whereas the edge at <strong>180</strong> degrees show what the student achieved in the assignments etc .
            </p>
            <p>
                If the students fall under a certain <strong>zone</strong> or if the delta symbol at the heart of the
                Spider Chart, shrinks down to
                certain level then the prediction of identifying weak
                students would work in order to mark the students as a reminder to improve their performances .
            </p>

                This overlaid bar chart helps to <strong>visualize</strong> the overall performances of all the students
                (section-wise) under the faculty's responsibility. The <strong>red bar</strong> represents the total
                marks of <strong>50</strong> whereas
                the <strong>blue bar</strong> represents the overall <strong>Mean</strong> of the scores achieved by the
                students in the
                particular section .
            </p>

                This image shows us the data of the overall scores the students were successful in achieving before
                finals since the marks that is in comparison is out total <strong>100</strong> . The Red bar being the
                total scores and
                the Blue bar being the scores actually achieved
            </p>

        <div class="ProjectConclusion">
            <p>
                Together with the help of <strong>Data Visualization</strong> techniques for both the students and the
                teachers, a better
                means of communication can be achieved which will help both the student and their teachers to follow-up
                throughout the semester .
